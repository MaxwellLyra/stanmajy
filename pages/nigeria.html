                                            <p>Abuja is home to several parks and green areas with the largest one being Millennium Park. Millennium Park was designed
                                            by architect Manfredi Nicoletti and was officially opened by the United Kingdom's Elizabeth II in December 2003. Another
                                            open area park is located in Lifecamp Gwarimpa; near the residence of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. The
                                            park is located on a slightly raised hilltop which contains sport facilities like Basketball and Badminton courts
                                            another park is the city park, it is located in wuse 2 and is home to numerous outdoor and indoor attractions such as a
                                            4D cinema, astro-turf, lawn tennis court, paintball arena and a variety of restaurants.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Lagos, subsequent to the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde
                                            Fashola, is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and in the world.
                                            Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originated from Iperu
                                            Remo, Ogun State), which took place on 25 April, was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily
                                            known as a business-oriented and a fast-paced community.</p>

											<p>Nigeria (Hausa: Nijeriya, Igbo: Naíjíríà, Yoruba: Nàìjíríà) is a country in equatorial West Africa. It is the
                                            continent's most populous nation. It has a southern coastline on the Gulf of Guinea, and has Benin to the west, Cameroon
                                            to the southeast, Chad to the northeast, and Niger to the north.
                                            Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. It is the largest
                                            African oil producer and, since April 2014, the largest economy in Africa.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                One of the official languages in Nigeria is English. However, while this may sound reassuring, only upper and
                                                middle-class people in the cities actually speak it outside of the formal environment, though most citizens have a good
                                                understanding of English. The national lingua franca is Nigerian pidgin, an English-based creole language spoken by 75
                                                million people as a second language and by 3-5 million people as a native language, mostly in the Niger Delta. Nigerian
                                                pidgin is highly intelligible to an English speaker to a certain degree, but it will take time to get accustomed to it.
                                                However, Nigerian pidgin will not hinder day-to-day communications. The easiest way to overcome any initial language
                                                block is to ask questions. They will not hesitate to ask you to clarify what you mean or admit that they do not
                                                understand an outsider's particular manner of phrasing or accent. Do not assume that a Nigerian's inability to answer
                                                you indicates ignorance.

                                                        <p>
                                                            Igbo-Ukwu (Igbo: Great Igbo) is a town in the Nigerian state of Anambra in the southeastern part of the country.It is
                                                            notable for three archaeological sites, where excavations have found bronze artifacts from a highly sophisticated bronze
                                                            metal-working culture dating perhaps to the ninth or tenth century, centuries before other known bronzes of the region.
                                                            
                                                            The first, called Igbo Isaiah, was uncovered in 1938 by Isaiah Anozie, a local villager, who found the bronze works
                                                            while digging beside his home. Formal excavations by the archaeologist Thurstan Shaw in 1959 at the request of the
                                                            Nigerian government, resulted in the discovery of two other sites, Igbo Richard and Igbo Jonah, containing the remains
                                                            of an ancient culture.
                                                            
                                                            Later, these were excavated as well. Artifacts have included jewelry, ceramics, a corpse adorned in what appears to be
                                                            regalia, and many assorted bronze, copper, and iron objects. Some of these contain materials that are evidence of a
                                                            long-distance trading system extending to Egypt.
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>Radiocarbon dating placed the sites around the tenth century or earlier, which would make the Igbo-Ukwu culture the
                                                        earliest-known example of bronze casting in the region. The craftsmen were working centuries before those who made the
                                                        more well-known Ife bronzes.</p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            The archaeological sites in southeastern Nigeria are associated with the Nri-Igbo. The three sites include Igbo Isaiah (a
                                                            shrine), Igbo Richard (a burial chamber), and Igbo Jonah (a cache).“The inhabitants of Igbo-Ukwu had a metal-working art
                                                            that flourished as early as the ninth century. Three sites have been excavated, revealing hundreds of ritual vessels and
                                                            regalia castings of bronze or leaded bronze that are among the most inventive and technically accomplished bronzes ever
                                                            made.
                                                            
                                                            The Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu has been revealed in bronzes dating from the 9th century, which were discovered during
                                                            excavations by Thurstan Shaw and his team in 1959 and 1964 in Igbo-Ukwu, an Igbo town in present-day Nigeria. A total of
                                                            three sites have been excavated, revealing bronze artifacts along with pottery and thousands of glass beads, materials
                                                            demonstrating trade with such distant cultures as the Egyptians.
